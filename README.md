Tetris Game

This is a classic tetris game made with the Pygame library. I had just learned the basics of python and pygame when I started this project.
The goal was to expand from the basics without using a tutorial on how to create a tetris game. I wanted to face the challenge of creating
this without an example or step by step guide. If I was struggling on a small concept then I would try the Pygame documentation first.
If I couldn't find the answers there then I would do outside research. Any references to a tetris tutorial or Q&A about a tetris game were avoided.

I enjoyed the frustration and pulling my hair out at times but I think this is just what programmers enjoy. Overall, I enjoyed the process and most
importanly learned many concepts about both python and pygame.



Getting started

To run in a python IDE, open the terminal or command prompt then run:

pip install pygame
